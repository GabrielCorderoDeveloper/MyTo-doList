## About the project
The project was made with React best practices in mind, like the camel case or pascal case. It is a component-based application and stores the data on the browser to avoid losing information when reloading the page or exiting. The animated links on the bottom are made to make the application more dynamic and eye catching, the psotioning is random and each time the animation executes it changes.
